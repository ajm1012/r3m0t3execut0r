What is Brutus and what can I do with it ?

Brutus is a well known password brute forcing program.With Brutus, you can brute force passwords for HTTP, FTP, POP3, Telnet, SMB (Netbios), Netbus, and they also have a "Custom" option so you can specify your own settings.You can use a proxy for each cracking method.

Cracking ::::::::::

...::::HTTP Form::::...{r3m0t3}

This is the option you would use if you want to crack into a website that has a field for a username and a pass, like this one.

http://www.westbranch.k12.oh.us/staff/controls.asp


I will use this site for the rest of this section as well.
First thing you wanna do is open Brutus, and select http form. Then click the modify sequence button. Once there we put the above link into the Target form field, then click Learn Form Settings
From here, you click the field name that is for the username, in this case it is userid, once you have selected it, click the username button that is shown above the cookie information. That tells brutus that that field is for the username. Then you select the password field and click the password button, then click accept. Next, in the HTML Response field you need to fill that in with the response you get when you try to enter a password into your site. In this case the response is "You have entered a wrong Password or username." For this target we will put that into the Primary response field Once this
is done, we click ok, add the IP into the Target Field and start our crack.

...::::FTP::::...{r3m0t3}

For cracking an FTP server, the default settings should remain how they are, I usually make sure that the "Try to stay connected for unlimited attempts" box is ticked.Thats up to you, once you have selected your options, enter the IP and being the crack.

...::::POP3::::...{r3m0t3}

This is pretty much the same as FTP cracking as far as, the default settings should work for you. Once again, I like to use the "Try to stay connected for unlimited attempts" option.

Steps :-

1.Download Brutus.

2.Extract on the place you want and then run it.

3.To hack email in target bar write: pop.yahoo.com

4.Type most be: POP3

5.Put connections to 60 and timeout to 60

6.Make sure you check a ''Single User''

7.Then when you check that to single user write in that bar you victims yahoo account ID e.g googleboy@yahoo.com, his ID will be googleboy <=write that

8.Password mod put on: ''Brute Force''

9.Then click ''Range''



10. Then make sure you put ''Min Length'' 6 and ''Max Length'' to 16

11.Then put custom range .. there will be default abcd.. etc and some numbers ..

12.Click OK

...::::Telnet::::...{r3m0t3}

Seems as if I'm repeating myself, but once again, the default settings should work for you.

...:::: SMB (Netbios)::::...{r3m0t3}

If you happen to find yourself a target that has the netbios port open (139) and has sharing enabled, but needs a password, this is what you would use. Once again, default settings should work.

...:::: Netbus ::::...{r3m0t3}

Netbus is a popular trojan that sometimes, you might find a server that needs a password to connect.
This option is used for, cracking a password protected Netbus server.

...::::Custom::::...{r3m0t3}

This is what you would use to set up a crack for anything else that you could think of.You need to find out what you need to put in each field once you click "Define sequence" Those options will vary from target to target.

This tut was written by me but credits also go to those who have helped me.

Happy Hacking !
