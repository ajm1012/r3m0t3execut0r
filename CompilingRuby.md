Okay today I will tell you how one has to compile programs of ruby.

Ruby :-

Lets take e.g. that your program you have saved in location d:\a\pro1.rb (Assuming you have Windows)

Okay so now go in start -> run -> cmd
Then, type "d:" (Without quotes) This takes you in D:
Then, type "cd a" (Without quotes This takes you in the a folder.
Then for compiling type "ruby pro1.rb " (Without quotes) This compiles the program and also displays the output.

Thats it !
